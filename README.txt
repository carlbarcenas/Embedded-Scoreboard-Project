Set-up for the project is as follows:\
1. Connect the LandTiger board to the host computer that will be running the uVision program.\
2. Open up the Python program.\
3. Connect the HC-06 Bluetooth module to the LandTiger. RX goes to P0.10 and TX goes to P0.11. Also, connect the power to the 5V on the board and ground to ground on the board.\
4. If the uVision project is not flashed on to the board, then download the flash and reset the board.\
5. After the \'93Initializing\'85\'94 screen shows up on the LCD screen, run the Python program. You should see data coming through the console of the IDE you are using.\
6. The LandTiger will keep displaying messages as it processes this data. Eventually the first game will be displayed.\
7. Use the INT0 button to cycle through the games.\
8. If a game is live, restart the entire process to get an updated score.}
